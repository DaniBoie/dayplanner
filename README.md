## My portfolio website for my first weeks of learning.

Day planner for your busy busy developer work day

This code was built for my 3rd week in the UCI coding bootcamp. 

*This was used for solidifying my new jqurey and local storage knowledge gained over the past week*

>This app was built with HTML and JavaScript, 
  Although my JavaScript is a bit repetitive due to my lack of thorough syntax knowledge I believe it shows what I meant to do in a more basic sense.
